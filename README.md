# 3D Object Detection Model
In this project, we aim to bridge the gap between 2D object detection and 3D scene understanding—a crucial step for applications like self-driving cars and robotics. While 2D object detection helps us identify and locate objects in images, it doesn’t tell us how far away these objects are. Knowing the distance is essential for navigating the real world safely. Our goal is to enhance 2D detections with depth information to approximate a 3D understanding of the scene.
